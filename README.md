# ðŸ“¦ ECIMS - Extensible Computerized Inventory Management System  

**ECIMS** is a simple, intuitive, and flexible inventory management solution tailored for single-location, product-based businesses. The systemâ€™s primary goal is to provide an **easy-to-use platform** for business owners with little to no technical expertise. With ECIMS, users can manage stock levels, orders, and suppliers with minimal effort, ensuring that important inventory tasks are streamlined and hassle-free.  

Built with **extensibility in mind**, the system can grow alongside the business, with additional features like shipment tracking and predictive analytics planned for future updates.  

## Project Overview

The goal of ECIMS is to deliver a scalable and adaptable inventory management system that allows businesses to:
- **Track stock levels in real-time.**
- **Automate the reorder process** to prevent shortages.
- **Manage supplier relationships** with ease.
- **Provide detailed order tracking and change logs** for complete visibility.

## Key Features

### 1. Owner Control and User Permissions
- **Full control** for the system owner, allowing modifications to the system.
- **Role-based access**: Owners can assign specific permissions (e.g., adding products, creating orders) to different users for granular control.

### 2. Inventory Management
- **Real-time tracking** of products, including the ability to monitor removed items with detailed records (e.g., product name, quantity, and supplier).
- **Red Flag Alerts**: Products falling below a threshold are flagged, ensuring they are not overlooked.

### 3. Order Management Workflow
- **In-System Blocking Alerts**: Managers receive immediate alerts when stock falls below threshold, requiring acknowledgment to continue.
- **Order Process**: 
  - Filter items by supplier and select quantities to order.
  - Orders can be updated before finalization.
  - Manual updates of order status from "Pending" to "Ordered" or "Delivered" ensure accurate tracking.
- **Order Verification**: On receiving products, managers verify quantities and update inventory accordingly.

### 4. Change Log & Order History
- **Comprehensive Change Log**: Logs all changes, including user actions, with timestamps for auditing and accountability.
- **Order History**: Tracks all past orders to help analyze spending and order patterns.

### 5. Notification System
- **Blocking Alerts** notify users when stock needs replenishing, ensuring critical products are not missed.
  
### 6. Flexibility and Future Expansion
- The system is designed for **modular expansion**, supporting:
  - **Shipment tracking** to monitor orders in transit.
  - **Predictive analytics** to forecast stock needs based on trends.
